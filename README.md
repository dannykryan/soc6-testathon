# Testathon: The testing hackathon

This project involves API testing using Vitest and Supertest, and end-to-end testing with Playwright.

# API Testing Objectives

- Use Vitest and Supertest for API testing.
- Create a `vitest.config.js` file for environment setup.
- Reset the database to a known initial state before each test.
- Cover scenarios for getting, creating, and deleting todos.

## End-to-End Testing

- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing.
- Simulate user actions and validate UI states.
- Write a test covering user flow: add todos, delete one, refresh, and verify.

Check `tests/todos.test.js` for an example testing script.
